# Employee_Turnover_prediction
Employee Turnover or Employee Turnover ratio is the measurement of the total number of employees who leave an organization in a particular year. Employee Turnover Prediction means to predict whether an employee is going to leave the organization in the coming period.

A Company uses this predictive analysis to measure how many employees they will need if the potential employees will leave their organization. A company also uses this predictive analysis to make the workplace better for employees by understanding the core reasons for the high turnover ratio.
This project foucses on building the prediction using logistic regression and random forest modelling.
